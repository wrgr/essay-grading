"""Grading prompts for Mode A (essay + trace), ported from TGFWA
src/lib/grading/prompts.ts.

Evidence-before-score output contract (TGFWA spec §5.2): the model must quote
evidence and reason against the anchors BEFORE emitting a score. "no-evidence"
is a valid outcome, never a guessed score.

The browser client enforced GRADING_SCHEMA via provider structured-output
modes; server-side we run providers through JSON mode (core.llm.llm_chat_json)
and append an explicit output-shape block to the prompt. The engine's
normalize_pass() remains the real guard — it validates and repairs every pass
regardless of what the provider claims to enforce.

1. Score ONLY the single criterion given. Ignore all other qualities of the writing (halo prevention).
2. Evidence before score: first collect verbatim quotes that bear on the criterion, then reason against the anchors, then score.
3. Every quote must appear VERBATIM in the source. Keep each quote under ~40 words.
4. If the source contains no evidence bearing on this criterion, output "no-evidence" as the score. Never guess.
5. Length is not quality: do not reward verbosity.
